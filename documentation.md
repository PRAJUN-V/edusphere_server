tried to setup rds but it is showing timeout error so I used render for database service.

setup s3 bucket but when I tried to upload large file like video it is showing error.
    - s3 bucket is now working.

Now I am going to setup EC2 instance
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-pip python3-dev nginx

added aws key in .env folder

to create virtual environment in server
    - virtualenv venv
